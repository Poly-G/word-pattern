# Word Pattern

## Code Challenge Directions

Given a `pattern` and a string `st`r, find if `str` follows the same `pattern`.

`follow` means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.

**Notes:**
You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters that may be separated by a single space.
